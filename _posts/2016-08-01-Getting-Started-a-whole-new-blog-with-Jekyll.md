I have started my new blog site using [Jekyll][jekyll] and [GitHub Page][github_page].

I'd like to write my articles in Markdown and manage them with git. [GitHub Page][github_page] is a great way to host my site.

Before I had managed my site with Wordpress and a hosting service, but it took much time to maintain it so that I got gloomy to write my blogs.

[Jekyll][jekyll] and [GitHub Page][github_page] make it easy and simple to maintain my blog site.

They match my needs.

[github_page]: https://pages.github.com
